### <a id="vendor-benefits"></a>With so much for customers, what's in store for the vendors?
- _An entirely separate frontend dashboard, where they can manage their products, coupons, orders, commissions, customer questions and much more ( technically termed as: **The Vendor Dashboard** )_.
- _Vendors get their dedicated store ( or vendor's shop ) and their equivalent store settings which they can manage themselves._
- _Vendors get a **weekly and monthly sales report** in the vendor dashboard itself._
- _For overseas marketplaces, vendors can also see their sales report based on locations, which country has ordered more of their products ( termed as: **Visitors Map** )._
- _They can also set their **shop location using Google maps**, they can also add their **external shop URL**, **link their social profiles**, which will be visible to the customers. In short, vendors can manage their profile completely from their dashboard._

##### ✓ In terms of Product Management: 
- _Vendors can **add or upload products** from their dashboard itself just as WooCommerce provides in the backend - which includes adding **virtual and downloadable products**, **setting tax or shipping classes**, **managing product tags**, **adding product attributes**, **manage the inventory of each product** and much more._
- _Vendors can also sell products previously listed by other vendors as theirs i.e. a product will have more than one vendor attached to it (this is called the much in demand **Single Product Multiple Vendors** )._
- _Vendors can also add their products **GTIN, ISBN or UAN number**._
- _A **categorical tree** or **Browse Tree Guides (BTG)** for products just like Amazon is also included for ease of product management._

##### ✓ Coupon Management:
- _Vendors can **create, edit, delete fixed/percentage coupons** ( applicable only for their products ) similar to WooCommerce._

##### ✓ Shipping and Tax Management:
- _Vendors can **enable or disable a shipping zone**, as is necessary._
- _**Add shipping methods** and **configure shipping rates**._
- _WC Marketplace also lets vendors configure **table rate shipping**, **flat rate**, **local pickup** and **free shipping**._

##### ✓ For Order Management:
- _Vendors can see and **manage all their orders** from the vendor dashboard itself._
- _They can **export their orders into a CSV**, **change the order status** and add an **order note for reference**._
- _Vendors can also **mark an order as shipped** and **issue refunds for customers**._

##### ✓ Coming to, Vendor's Commissions:
- _Vendors can select their preferred mode of payment - supported payment methods are: **PayPal, Stripe and Direct Bank Transfer**._
- _Vendors receive their commissions at equal periods of time according to the payment schedule set by the admin although vendor does have an option to withdraw all or some of his pending dues at any point of time ( technically, it is termed as  **Request Withdrawal Commission** )._
- _Vendors also have an access to their very own **ledger book** where they can see all of their **transaction history** and it's details._

###### _Simply hassle-free with just initial setups._
- _**Automatic setup wizard** for a perfect online store setup._
- _Admin can easily **customise the vendor's registration form** with innumerable built in form elements._
- _Adding, managing or rejecting a **vendor's application** are under admin's supervision._
- _**Set announcements** and **upload knowledgebases** for vendors._
- _Admin configures and controls the **single product multiple vendors** flow._
- _The admin also decides on the **template applicable for the vendor's shop** from a list of various predefined templates._
- _An admin can generate sales report for each vendor ( termed as: **Vendor wise sales report** )._
- _An exclusive **to-do list** for the admin is included for easier operation and management of the store._
- _Admin can **accept payments from customers using any payment gateway** that are supported by WooCommerce._

##### ✓ Incase of Product Management:
- _Admin **manages the product types** that a vendor can upload from their dashboard._
- _**Automatic or manual approval** from the admin is necessary after a product is submitted by the vendor._

##### ✓ Coupon Management:
- _Similar to product management, **automatic or manual approval** from the admin is necessary after the coupon has been submitted by the vendor._
- _When an admin creates a coupon, the **coupon will be available across the entire website irrespective of vendors**._

##### ✓ In terms of admin's control over vendor's capability:
- _An admin can **block or even suspend a vendor**._
- _**Hide or display vendor's contact details** and **choose a colour template** for the vendors dashboard apart from vendor's product management capabilities discussed above._

##### ✓ Shipping and Tax Management:
- _**Adding and configuring shipping zones** are all under admin's workload._
- _**Configuring tax classes and tax rates** are also one of admin's primary roles._

##### ✓ Configuring vendor's commissions:
- _Admin can choose from a variety of commission types: **Commission per product**, **Commission per vendor** and **Commission per category**._
- _Admin can configure the **allowable payment methods** for a vendor to receive payments, **the commission payment schedule**, **withdrawal locking period** ( time period after which the vendor can request for a withdrawal of commission ), **set disbursement threshold** ( the minimum monetary amount of pending commission required over which the vendor will be allowed to request for a withdrawal ) and **payment gateway charge** (on setting this, the set amount will be deducted from the vendor's pending dues )._
- _Similar to WooCommerce order page, WC Marketplace also provides a **commission page** separately. Here, the admin can manage commissions entirely and change it's status._
